# Demand Forecasting and Analysis

In this project, we forecast sales for the next 3 months for 50 different products across 10 different stores using 5 years of store-item sales data. The dataset includes daily sales figures for each store and product. We've applied various techniques to analyze this time series data and predict future demand using machine learning methods.

This repository contains a Databricks notebook titled **demand_forecasting_profiling.ipynb** that analyzes campaign data using various Python data analysis libraries. Additionally, the notebook integrates with the **Fire Notebook SDK** to manage the outputs.


## Features

1. **Model Utilization**: Employed the LightGBM algorithm for sales forecasting. LightGBM is effective in handling large datasets and provides high accuracy.

2. **Time Series Features**: To enhance model accuracy, we created several key date features:

## Requirements

To run the notebook and utilize the **Fire Notebook SDK**, you will need the following:

- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- plotly
- Fire Notebook SDK

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas pyspark plotly
```

You can install the fire notebook sdk using:

```bash
pip install https://sparkflows-release.s3.amazonaws.com/fire/jupyter-docker/firenotebookwheel/fire_notebook-3.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

You can follow the documentation on how to create notebooks and use the fire notebook SDK here:
